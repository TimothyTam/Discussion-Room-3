 - Query like Modifies(2,"v") -> invalid since ambiguous
 - Is there any procedure that does not modify any variable ? Assuming No.
 - Query with Modifies(_,"v") should be invalid
 - can PKB.getUsesGenericSpecific(int val, NodeType) handle Uses(p,"v") ?
 - also, PKB.getUsesSpecificGeneric ?
 - what does getProcIndexFromName return if not found ?

 Note: need to take into account ParamType == procname and stuff in building the graph

 Note: needs PKB APIs to get the procname of the call statements

 pattern while(const,..) = invalid
 some test cases mising the declaration
